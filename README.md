# Per una sistematizzazione dell'ASDV

This repository contains:

1. An appendix to the article "Longhin, Marco. Per una sistematizzazione dell'*Archivio sonoro dei dialetti veneti* (Oral Archives Journal, under review)" presenting the complete lists of municipalities investigated within the ASDV, of those for which no recordings are available, and of the fusion of municipalities that affected the provinces of Veneto after the 1980s. The lists are completed by additional information for each municipality, such as year of recording and age of the informants, drawn from the accompanying documentation.

2. A draft version for the visualisation of the municipalities of Veneto through interactive maps. The website is available at: [https://marcolonghin.github.io/ASDV-OArJ/](https://marcolonghin.github.io/ASDV-OArJ/)
